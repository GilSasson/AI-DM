Time series stock analysis.  This dataset looks at the data from the “FAANG” companies (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google). 
This data was taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/aayushmishra1512/faang-complete-stock-data.  
Your goal is to take anyone of the five Faang companies and predict if will go up or down *the next day* based on the previous day’s data (or more). 
You can create new fields like the day of the month like: https://www.extendoffice.com/documents/excel/821-excel-convert-date-to-weekday-month-name.html.  
You also need to create the binary field if the stock went up or down. I put an example of this at:

You can perform this task for any of the five FAANG stocks, but a higher score will be given to a model that works on at least two of them.
